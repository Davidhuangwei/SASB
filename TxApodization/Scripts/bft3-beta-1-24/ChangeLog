beta 1.24
 Bugs fixed:
  - xmt_apodization property of line not working
  - Euler angles fixed, now the third axis is computed correctly
beta 1.20
 Form, Fit and Function:
  - Threads are not scheduled to run on specific cores
 Bugs fixed:
  - Max threads now equals 24	
 Known bugs:
  - xmt_apodization property of line not working
beta 1.19
 Form, Fit and Function:
  - Introduced 2D aperture setup
 Bugs fixed:
  - No clever tricks are made to not beamform points which no RF data can affect.
 Known bugs:
  - Active cores are selected to start with the non-hyperthreaded ones,
    even though they are heavily loaded.
  - Maximum number of cores equals 16
beta 1.17
 Form, Fit and Function:
  - Apodization is now calculated using an orientation property on the
    transmit aperture to make transmit apodization symmetric around
    center of beam
 Bugs fixed:
 Known bugs:
beta 1.16
 - DO NOT USE THIS RELEASE
 Form, Fit and Function:
  - Manual apodization changed into parametric
 Bugs fixed:
 Known bugs:
beta 1.13
 Form, Fit and Function:
 Bugs fixed:
  - Tukey window fixed
 Known bugs:
  - Cubic interpolation incorrect (nearest, linear and spline works)
  - When beamforming using SA, the first relevant point on a line are
    computed using tstart. This is done incorrectly, a work-around is
    to put a scatterer close to the aperture.
beta 1.12
 Form, Fit and Function:
 Bugs fixed:
  - Annoying warning removed when setting orientation of apodizations
 Known bugs:
  - Tukey window is not working correctly, should produce Hann window for
    window parameter R equal to 0 and Rectwin (for R=1).
  - Cannot reset positions for transducers, remove ,data in set.pos function
  - Sign error for z-coordinate on 'convex_array' transducers
beta 1.9
 Form, Fit and Function:
  - Focus delays can now be acquired for convex transducers
  - Apodizations can now be assigned lines and afterwards, apodization
    values can be extracted
 Bugs fixed:
  - Parametric apodization using manual=true now works for line samples
    of arbitrary length
  - Plane-wave have been fixed to produce correct output

beta 1.4
 Form, Fit and Function:
  - The first version of a user guide is included
 Bugs fixed:
 Known bugs:
  - Parametric apodization using manual=true only works for line samples
    of length c/(2*fs)
beta 0.7
 Form, Fit and Function:
  - Plane-parallel wave support. Enabled ppwave on aperture. If enabled, the
	time-of-flights are calculated from the plane containing
	center_focus and perpendicular to orientation on apodization to
	the focus points. If focus is set (VS), the plane contains the
	focus (VS) and the distance to the focus points are either added
	or subtracted, similar to beamforming using a virtual source. This
	applies to both transmit and receive so for an ordinary plane-wave
	setup only the ppwave property should be enabled on the transmit
	aperture.
 Bugs fixed:
  - Delays on aperture are now in seconds rather than samples.
 Known bugs:
  - Parametric apodization using manual=true only works for line samples
    of length c/(2*fs)
beta 0.6
 Form, Fit and Function:
  - Added posibility for creating multiple lines at a time
  - Compounding multiple angles at a time using bft3_sampled_image
 Bugs fixed:
 Known bugs:
  - Delays are not working
beta 0.5
 Form, Fit and Function:
  - Additional parameter for off-setting dynamic apodization weights
 Bugs fixed:
 Known bugs:

beta 0.4
 Form, Fit and Function:
  - Apodization using distances and values are now referred to as 'manual'
  - Fixed apodization introduced for SampledImages specified by a number
	of active elements, a window, and possibly a window parameter.
  - Possibility to save an Aperture object by converting it to a struct and
	constructing the object again using this struct.
 Bugs fixed:
  - Supplying wrong arguments to Image constructor no longer gives AV
  - Memory leak introduced in beta 0.1
 Known bugs:
