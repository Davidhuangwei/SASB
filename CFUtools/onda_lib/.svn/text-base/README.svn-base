The source code can be compiled by running run_me.sh
run_me.sh assumes that MATLAB is installed at: /usr/local/matalb2010b_64bit
In Ubuntu the prerequisites to run run_me.sh should be covered by installing/running:
sudo apt-get install build-essential automake cmake libcppunit-dev g++



To manually compile the software run:

# Generate configure script
aclocal -I /usr/share/aclocal -I./config
autoheader
automake --add-missing
autoconf

# Configure and tell where MATLAB is located
./configure --with-matlab=<path to MATLAB>

# Compile
make
